The following are things that should be included in any critical review of a 
book. Be sure to integrate information about the book summary, content 
analysis, book overview, author background, book mechanics, and reviews by 
others in a thoughtful, smooth-flowing essay. It should not be a rote listing 
of information predicated on the list below.

1. **Summary of the book**: Explain the thesis, themes, and organization of 
   the book with specific examples.
2. **Analysis of the book content**: Is the purpose of the book stated? 
   Implied? Is the purpose achieved? Is the book effectively organized? 
   Chronologically, thematically, or topically? Is the book well-written? 
   Poorly written? What is the audience level, in your opinion? Is there bias? 
   Objectivity? Balance? What kinds of problems present themselves to writing 
   this book?
3. **Overview**: What are the book's strengths? Weaknesses? Why? Use specific 
   examples.

In addition, look up the following information and incorporate it into your 
essay:

1. **Author background**: What other works, if any, has the author written? 
   What is/was the author's position? Profession? Education? Is the author, in 
   your opinion, qualified to write the book? Upon what basis?
2. **Book mechanics**: Are most sources primary? Secondary? Are the sources 
   exhaustive? Superficial? Is the book noted properly? Is the book noted 
   extensively? Sporadically? Does the book include maps? Charts? Photos? 
   Tables? An index? Appendices? Does the title reflect the content of the 
   book? Does the title contain substantive and chronological information? 
3. **Reviews by others**: Are reviews of the book favorable? Unfavorable? Why? 
   Where are the reviews published?

The essay should be 3-5 pages, typewritten, double spaced. Yes, style 
(spelling, grammar, etc.) counts. Please include a cover sheet with your name, 
date, and the class title. Quotations from the book should be handled with 
parenthetical notation: e.g., (p. 78). References to other sources, including 
book reviews, should be handled appropriately, using proper Chicago style 
citation form.
